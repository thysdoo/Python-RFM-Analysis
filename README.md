# Customer Behavior Analysis By RFM Model
**Objective**: Analyze customer behavior using the RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers and provide actionable insights for enhancing business strategies.

**Contributions**:
Utilized Computational Thinking to deconstruct the problem, identify necessary calculations, and outline the steps required for analysis.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and preprocess raw data, ensuring accuracy and reliability for further calculations.
Computed RFM scores for each customer, enabling segmentation into distinct groups with similar behaviors and characteristics.
Visualized customer segments using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Squarify, creating clear and engaging visuals for easier interpretation of results.
Prepared a detailed slide report to explain the project methodology, findings, and strategic recommendations for improving customer retention and targeting.

**Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Squarify).
